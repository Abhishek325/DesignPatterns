#Strategy pattern:

1. Falls under Behavioural patterns, defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a 
   specific behavior.

2. Existing code explained:
    i.  Algorithms: 
         AddAlgorithm(To add two numbers), 
         SubstractAlgorithm(To substract two numbers)

    ii. IStrategy - A Strategy interface that defines some abstraction operation.

    iii. Context  - Provides context to the strategy and invokes the corresponding algorithm (Add/Substract).

    iv. StrategyPatternMain - Just to run everything!
